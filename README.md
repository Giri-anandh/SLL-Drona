# SLL Drona
## Vision
To provide an open-source Labview UI Testing Framework to automate manual UI testing. 

UI testing plays an important part in the overall testing process of each application/product. Drona allows Engineers to automate the UI test by writing test cases that involve the concept of setting values to UI controls and asserting it to check the test case. It increases the overall software quality, which is predominantly needed in today's existing or developing products. It also reduces the time taken by engineers to test the UI.

## SLL Drona in GLA Summit
SLL Drona as an Open Source LabVIEW UI testing framework was presented at GLA Summit 2022. For more details please watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JryzEPQexM)


## Minimum Compatible LabVIEW Version
The source code is saved with LabVIEW 2016.

## Installation
Please find the latest SLL Drona package available [here](https://github.com/solitontech/SLL-Drona/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and install it using VI Package Manager.

## Usage
Drona provides a library of VIs that are used to automate and test the UI without any flaws. It can be used to test any LabVIEW application and supports creating test cases from SLL Drona APIs.

## Palette
To test the UI of the application you need to create the test cases using corresponding SLL Drona APIs. It can be accessed under the following location.

## Workflow
Drona provides a library of APIs that helps to create test cases for UI testing. There are certain steps in creating a test case to make the workflow of the UI testing smooth and possible. The 4 steps that need to be followed for creating test cases are:

1. [Setup](#1-setup)
2. [Stimulus](#2-stimulus)
3. [Assert](#3-assert)
4. [Cleanup](#4-cleanup)

You can find the related APIs to these steps in the SLL Drona palette

### 1. Setup:
- The first step in creating the test case is setting up the project and creating a Drona configuration file parallel to the project.
- The configuration file includes the Launcher VI (startup VI that launches the UI to be tested) path, which is relative to the INI file, and options for opening and running the VI while executing the test.
- Test cases can be created after configuring the file.
- The Application reference and VI reference obtained from Setup VI are used to create test cases.

If you are using Drona for a LabVIEW application, then the INI file has to be created parallel to it.

### 2. Stimulus:
<ul>Stimulus is used to assign values to the controls and to give instructions, for executing UI actions. A collection of stimulus VIs are provided by this poly API, which can be found in the SLL Drona palette.</ul>

![Stimulus Control](Images/Stimulus%20API%20control.png) ![Stimulus Keyboard](Images/Stimulus%20API%20keyboard.png) ![Stimulus VI](Images/Stimulus%20API%20VI.png) <br/>
<ul>Set values for a control that is inside a tab control, cluster or any other object by giving a proper valid control path and value for that control. The control path is used to specify the UI control hierarchy to access a specific control. </ul>

For example, To access the numeric control as in the below depicted UI, the control path has to be given as: <br/>
![Stimulus control](Images/Stimulus%20control.png) <br/>
*Tab Control>>Cluster>>Numeric* <br/><br/>
The label name has to be given as mentioned below. <br/>
![Stimulus workflow](Images/Stimulus%20workflow.png) <br/>
Make sure it is the same as the label name and is case-sensitive. </ul>

### 3. Assert:
<ul>Assert is used to verify the controls' values, contents, properties, etc. and return the test report. A collection of assert VIs are provided by this poly API, which can be found in the SLL Drona palette. </ul>

![Assert Control Value](Images/Assert%20Control%20value.png) ![Assert Control Disable](Images/Assert%20Control%20disable.png) ![Assert Subpanel Inserted VI](Images/Assert%20Subpanel%20Inserted%20VI.png) ![Assert VI](Images/Assert%20VI%20Exec.png) ![Assert Control Visibility](Images/Assert%20Control%20visible.png) 
<ul>Similar to the stimulus step, a valid control path has to be given. </ul> 

For example, To assert the value for the string in the below sample UI, the input has to be given as <br/>
![Assert control](Images/Assert%20control.png)<br/>
*Tab Control>>Tab Control 2>>Cluster>>String* <br/>
![Assert workflow](Images/Assert%20workflow.png)
### 4. Cleanup:
<ul> This VI closes all the references that are opened while setting up the test case. Provide this VI with the Launcher VI reference and application reference that need to be closed. </ul>

## Examples
Find the examples for different use cases in the following path: <br/>
<*LabVIEW>\vi.lib\SLL Drona\Examples*  <br/>
A set of 5 examples are available based on the use case
